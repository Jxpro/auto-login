# Auto-Login

## introduction

This is a project about automatically logging in to the campus network, including Python and JavaScript scripts, and the campus network is authenticated through the portal protocol.

**Note that** this is just some experience and ideas sharing. If different parameters appear in the respective application process, you need to analyze it yourself

## How to use

1.   Rename the `config_template.json` to `config.json`
2.   Modify the parameters according to the actual situation

-   `xyw_full.py` simulates the real parameter construction, including the complete query and authentication process.
-   `xyw_light.py` simplifies unnecessary parameters and only completes the authentication process
